# Work Style & Learning Preferences

## Learning Mode

I learn best through hands-on practice, supported by reading documentation and good short videos.

## Problem-Solving Approach

I break the problem into smaller steps, debug logically, check logs/errors, and test solutions one by one.

## Communication Preferences

I’m comfortable with async communication but open to quick sync calls when needed. Occasional check-ins work best for me.

## Handling Ambiguity

I can work even when requirements aren’t fully clear, and I ask the right questions early to understand what’s needed.

## Independent vs Collaborative Work

I work well independently but collaborate whenever it helps align understanding or solve problems faster.

# Mentorship & Expectations

## What I Need from You (Shailendra)

* I need clear technical guidance when I'm learning new concepts or working on unfamiliar areas.
* I need to learn from him and gain as much experience and growth under his guidance.
* I need proper product context before starting a task so I understand the goal and what’s expected.

## Feedback Preferences

* I prefer direct, clear, and actionable feedback that helps me see what to improve.
* Short, timely feedback works best for me so I can adjust quickly.

## Handling Blockers

* I first try to debug issues independently by reviewing logs, documentation, and code.
* If I am stuck for too long or progress is slowing, I escalate early with a clear summary of what I tried and where I’m blocked.

# Availability & Work Rhythm

## Work Hours

I am most productive during the daytime, especially late mornings to early evenings. This is when I can focus the best and maintain consistent output.

## Weekend Availability

I am comfortable with a 6-day working schedule. On weekends, I prefer working with a structured plan so I can manage my tasks effectively while maintaining balance.

## Energy Levels

I am more of a daytime person — my energy and concentration peak during the morning to early evening hours rather than late at night.

# Goals & Aspirations

## 3-Month Goals

* I want to improve my backend skills.
* I want to get better at system design and building scalable architectures.
* I want to become more confident in expressing my ideas clearly.

## Career Direction (2–3 Years)

* I see myself growing as a strong backend engineer with deep expertise in APIs and microservices.
* I want to become a specialist who can design services end-to-end and contribute to architectural decisions.

## Success Definition

* Success for me means delivering reliable, clean, and scalable services while continuously improving my technical depth.
* Being able to take ownership of tasks, solve problems independently, and collaborate smoothly with the team.
* Growing steadily in confidence, communication, and technical decision‑making.
